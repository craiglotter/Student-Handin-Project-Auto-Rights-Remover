Student Handin Project Auto Rights Remover
==========================================

Student Handin Project Creator generated student hand in folders for given course assignments, automatically giving each student full rights to their respective folders. The problem is that after a given time these rights need to be revoked.

Student Handin Project Auto Rights Remover is simply an application that runs every so often, checking hand in folders for access times and removing or addding student rights accordingly.
